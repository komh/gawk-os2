     On OSX 10.11.6, I still get warnings that left-shifting a negative value
is undefined when handling TYPE_MINIMUM(time_t) in builtin.c.  time_t
is a signed 64-bit integer.  'TYPE_MINIMUM(char)' triggers warnings too,
so the size isn't an issue, just the signedness.

     Despite the warnings, the build finishes successfully and the test suite
passes without any failures now that igncas3 is skipped by 'make check'.
I don't have MPFR so those tests aren't being run.

I have reports of success on this compiler:

$ gcc --version

--with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.54) (based on LLVM 3.5svn)

There are reports of compilation issues on Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite).
The only compiler reported to have produced a complete pass of
"make check" is the MacPorts compiler, /opt/local/bin/clang-mp-3.5.
