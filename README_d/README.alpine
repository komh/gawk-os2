============================

I have a report that Alpine Linux uses BusyBox for its utilities. In
particular, the BusyBox ls does not have a -f option. This option is
needed in at least one of the tests.

Install coreutils on your Alpine Linux system:

	apk add coreutils

in order to get a fully POSIX-compliant ls.
